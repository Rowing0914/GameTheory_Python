## Problem Settings
* Two suspects are arrested because they were sneaking around the headquatre of the bank of Japan in Tokyo.
* The police think that they were trying to steal huge money from there. However, the police can only prove that the suspects were bringing the confidential map of the building.
* Thus, the police need one of criminals to confess or betray the other.

## Confliction in Benefit
* If no one confess, the police can only charge the prisoners for stealing the confidential map of the building.
	- Punishment: 1 month in jail each
* If one confesses and the other does not, the police will be merciful on the one confess and severely punish the quiet one
	- Punishment: 12 months in jail for the quiet one; 0 month for the confess one
* If both confess, the police punish both of them equally
	- Punishment: 8 months in jail each

## Question
* Suppose the thieves only want to minimise the extent of punishments on them in jail. Should they confess to the police?

## Note
* They are unavailable to communicate each other! So they need to decide themselves. No cooperation holds.
